# .NET Core 2.1 implementation of Haveibeenpwned.com RESTFul Api
[Haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) provides a means to check if user's private information has been leaked or compromised. 
Pwned.AspNetCore .NET Core implementation of the restful api allows integraion of this service within Asp.Net Core application.

This library can be used to extend the Asp.Net Core Identity library to support with `password` and `email` check to see if users' private information has been compromised by recent known data breach.

Users can enter an email address, and see a list of all known data breaches with records tied to that email address. In addition custom details queries can be made to retrieve information of the each data breach, such as the backstory of the breach and what specific types of data were included in it.
